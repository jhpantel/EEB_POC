- Look into ethical requirements - Katherine to ask Diversity EEB folks about
- GitHub account - send an email around that we're going to set this up, setup
  - links --> how to link authors to papers/a bibliography

- One page with all of the author information, another with ORCID etc.
  - Berkeley - endless debates about database restrictions, disclipine, boundaries with other groups (e.g. EEB, Diversify EEB)

Sept 19 - 

Something to bring up: how to hide emails? Just provide a web address? What if this changes? 

ORCID: let the app get all your papers, or specify individual papers - get permission to upload all papers?
	Check box for permission to search DOI for author info, then look at linked papers from that author.

Older papers or later career scientists for deceased folks - how do you deal with this?
