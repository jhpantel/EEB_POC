# This is R code for automatically retrieving EEB_POC papers from their 
# twitter handle. 
#
# This has been worked out following the examples here:
# https://utstat.toronto.edu/~nathan/teaching/sta4002/Class1/scrapingtwitterinR-NT.html
#=============================================================================
#=============================================================================
# If this is the first time running this then it is necessary to authenticate 
# this on Twitter first. 
# You need to have a twitter account. If you do not have one go to 
# http://twitter.com/signup and set one up. Also you need to have a modile number 
# as part of this account.
#
# After have created a twitter account you need to go to https://apps.twitter.com 
# and sign on with your twitter account.
#
# Once you click on the “Create New App” button you will go to the Create an 
# Application screen. There are three fields, a click box and a button you need 
# to click on this page. The three fields are Name, Description and Website. 
# The name of the application must be unique so this may take a few tries. 
# The description needs to be at least 10 character long, and put in a website. 
# If you do not have one you can use https://bigcomputing.blogspot.com.
# Now click the “Yes, I agree” box for the license agreement and click the
# “Create your Twitter application”.
